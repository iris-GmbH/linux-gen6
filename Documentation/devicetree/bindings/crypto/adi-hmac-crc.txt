ADI Cryptographic Accelerator included in sc58x chips.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "adi,hmac-crc"
- reg : Should contain CRC registers location and length
- interrupts : Should contain CRC interrupt number
- dma_channel : source memory dma channel used by the CRC
- crypto_crc_poly : initial poly data for crc calculation

Example:

crc0: crc@0x31001200 {
	compatible = "adi,hmac-crc";
	reg = <0x31001200 0xFF>;
	interrupts = <0 176 0>;
	dma_channel = <8>;
	crypto_crc_poly = <0x5c5c5c5c>;
};
