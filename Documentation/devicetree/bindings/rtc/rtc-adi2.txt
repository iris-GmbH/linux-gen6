ADI Real Time Clock v2

Required properties:
- compatible	: "adi,rtc2" for RTC on sc58x SoC family.
- reg		: Address range of rtc registers
- interrupts	: rtc events
- calibration	: The time seconds correction at the end of every day. Range
		  1 ~ 7 means to delay 0 to 7 seconds. Range 9 ~ 15 means to
		  speed up 1 ~ 7 seconds.

Example:

rtc@0x310C8000 {
	compatible = "adi,rtc2";
	reg = <0x310C8000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <0 165 0>;
	calibration = /bits/ 8 <0>;
};
